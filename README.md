LEARN PYTHON WITH CORAY SCHAFER IN YOUTUBE


Hello,

These are the notes from a youtube channel but since they are very detailed in explanation
Any non-python user who is used to any programming language before can benefit from these notes thoroughly

There is a youtube link at the end of the all .py files which I took the notes from.

Thanks
